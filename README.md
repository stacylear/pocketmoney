# Pocket Money

Traditional budget apps want you to assign every dollar to a category. But what if you just want to know how much discretionary money you will have once your regular expenses have been subtracted from your income? That's what Pocket Money does - it tells you how much you'll have in your pocket once you've paid your bills.

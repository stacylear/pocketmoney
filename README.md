# Pocket Money

Traditional budget apps want you to assign every dollar to a category... but what if you just want to know how much discretionary money you will have once your regular expenses have been subtracted from your income? That's what Pocket Money does - it tells you how much you'll have in your pocket once you've paid your bills.

## Lessons Learned

I wanted to create something simple that would allow me to work with LocalStorage options for user data. This project also taught me how to implement Toast messages in Javascript. I used the Materialize CSS library, because I've been comparing different types of default stylings that incorporate components so that I'll be familiar with several ways to implement CSS.

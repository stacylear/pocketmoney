# Pocket Money

Traditional budget apps want you to assign every dollar to a category... but what if you just want to know how much discretionary money you will have once your regular expenses have been subtracted from your income? That's what Pocket Money does - it tells you how much you'll have in your pocket once you've paid your bills.

## Features

Tap the plus (+) button to income or expense to add a transaction. You can edit or delete transactions by clicking on the transaction.

The dashboard at the top will show the total income, expenses, and your remaining pocket money.
